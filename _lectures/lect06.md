# Review


# Questions:

* Q: If we want to extract a certain part of a string using negative indexing, what kind of format should we use?
  * A: A similar way, using the same logic. Just remember that the last number in the index is NOT included.
  ```python
  alpha = "abcdefghi"
  >>> alpha[-9:-7]
  "ab"
  ```
  As a shortcut if you donâ€™t want to count the characters, use the length function!
  ```python
  alpha = "abcdefghi"
  >>> alpha[-len(alpha):-7]
  "ab"
  ```
  
* Q: Does capitalization matter when you compare strings?
  * A: Yes! "y" is not the same as "Y"
  
* Q: Do you use the return in the hello() function because of the conditional??
  * A: No. Return  vs print has nothing to do with the conditional of the function. The instructions 
  were what specified to return rather than just print.

# Using Conditionals

Example:
```python

raining = input("is it raining? [y/n]")

if (raining == 'y')
    print("It is raining")
    
elif (raining == 'n'):
    print('it is not raining')

else:
    print("not an option")
    
```

if you wanted to be able to use other inputs ('y' 'yes' 'Y') to be able to output "It is raining", 
you would do so by changing the conditional like this:

```python

if (raining == 'y' or raining == 'Y' or raining == 'yes'):
    print("It is raining")
    
```

Q: could we get around this by putting all possible conditionals in a list or something and then use an in statement???
A: Yes!

```python

if raining in ('y','Y','yes'):
    print("It is raining")
    
```
