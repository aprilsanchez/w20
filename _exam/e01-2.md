 ## Exam logistics

Exam is in the regular lecture classroom at the usual lecture time.
* Exam begins exactly at the start of the lecture - **Please start arriving 5 minutes before class**, so that you are ready when the exam begins. 

* There will be a seating chart projected on the screen and the TAs will have a physical copy of it, so they'll be able to help you locate your seat.

* You will be given a copy of the exam: you are supposed to work on the copy that you are given and should not trade it with your neighbors. Not following this guideline is considered a violation of academic integrity and can result in receiving a 0 for the exam.

* Bring your **student ID**: we will collect yours during the exam and return it back to you when you turn in your exam and your notesheet.

*    No books, calculators, phones, laptops or other materials or devices are allowed during the exam. Using them during the exam are a violation of academic integrity and can result in receiving a 0 for the exam.

* You may turn in your exam and the notesheet before the end of the exam.

* As soon as you turn in the exam and get your idea, please leave the classroom immediately.

*    There are no makeups for this exam.
