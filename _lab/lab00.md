# Introduction

Your first lab for this week is an introduction to programming on CSIL and in the Computer Science lab. You will write your first Python program that will print a specific text output on your computer display.

## Goals for this lab

By the time you have completed this lab, you should be able to:

* use the computers in Phelps 3525 (and other labs like CSIL) to do basic things such as:
   * perform basic management of directories and files
   * create Python progams in IDLE 
   * submit an assignment using the Gradescope system
   
This assignment is designed to make sure you are comfortable working in the 
computing environment and know how to submit your work. It is mostly about
mechanics, not concepts. Future labs will require quite a bit more thought!

# Step by Step Instructions

## Step 1: Verify your College of Engineering Account(s)

Before coming to lab,
create a College of Engineering account (also known as a ECI account, or a CSIL account) at this link:

<https://accounts.engr.ucsb.edu/create/>

We hope you did that&mdash;if so, you should be able to use that account to login on the computers in Phelps 3525, as well as the computers in the CSIL lab. 

If you ever forget the password to your ECI/CSIL account, you can reset it here:

<https://accounts.engr.ucsb.edu/maintain/>

If your account doesn't work, ask a TA for assistance.

Phelps 3525 is only available during your weekly scheduled lab section and during open lab hours.

At other times during the week, you can work in CSIL, the &quot;Computer Science Instructional Lab&quot;.

The CSIL lab, by the way, is on the ground floor of Harold Frank Hall.  The glass front doors of Harold Frank Hall look out towards the ocean.  Stand just outside those doors with your back towards the ocean.   The doors to the CSIL lab are just on your right.  (If you can't look over your shoulder and see an great big tree, with the ocean just behind it, you are on the wrong side of the building.)   Hours vary--its open almost all the time during the regular school year.
